I have developed a URL shortener using Python and the pyshorteners library. 
This project allows users to convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links.
The core of this project is the pyshorteners library, which provides a simple way to interact with various URL shortening services, 
such as Bit.ly, TinyURL, and many more.
