🔊 Python Voice Assistant: Hands-Free Control 🐍

This cutting-edge application harnesses the power of various libraries to enable hands-free control and interaction with your computer.

Here's a glimpse of what it can do:
📦 Leveraging Top Libraries:
I've harnessed the power of SpeechRecognition for accurate voice recognition, Text-to-Speech (TTS) libraries for natural responses, and NLP for understanding and executing voice commands.

🎯 Key Features:
🗣️ Voice Commands: It responds to a wide range of voice commands making everyday tasks a breeze, Tells us about the current time and date.
🌐 Web Queries: Search the web, check the latest news, or get real-time weather updates with just your voice.
🎵 Media Control: Play music videos on Youtube as well.

This project has not only honed my Python skills but also allowed me to explore the exciting world of voice-controlled technology.
